# Git Branching & GitHub Flow

Think about how you generally work on some code. You write some code then decide you want to try something else, so you make a copy, maybe you name it `version-2`. Then you decide you want to try something else, you copy and name it `version-3`.

Now you have a litter of different files for different features you’ve tried out.

Git branching solves this problem by providing a clean way to make copies of your code to work on a specific feature.
